Thank you for buying Ultimate Screenshot Maker (USM), a tool that can save you hours of tedious work.

No coding required. Just a few drag-and-drops and a single press of a button and the work is done.

The USM simply takes a batch of prefabs, light groups, and cameras and produce screenshots of all combinations automagically :-).

To see USM in action open Demo scene located in UltimateScreenshotMaker/Example or see this how-to video:

The dimensions of output images matches the dimensions of Game Tab times scale parameter.
